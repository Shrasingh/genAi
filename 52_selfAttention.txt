word embedding :- average embedding -> we need contextual embedding
Attention Mechanism:- sequential attention -> parallel

contextual embedding parallelism -> self attention

dot product:- semantic relation similarity
embedding:- 
            static
            dynamic:-
                      contextual
                      task based embedding




1. What is Self-Attention?
Self-Attention is a mechanism that allows a model to focus on different parts of the input sequence while encoding a particular word.Instead of processing words in order (like RNNs), self-attention lets each word look at other words to understand context and meaning.

üî∑ 3. How Self-Attention Works? (Step-by-Step)
Let‚Äôs say input = ["The", "cat", "sat"]


Step 1: Create Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V)
For each word embedding vector x, we create:
symbol      meaning
| Symbol | Meaning                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Q      | What this word is looking for |
| K      | What this word contains       |
| V      | The value this word carries   |
these are learned projections:
     Q = X * W_Q
     K = X * W_K
     V = X * W_V


where:
X: input matrix (tokens as embeddings)
W_Q, W_K, W_V: learned weight matrices


Step 2: Compute Attention Scores (Similarity)
We compare Q with K: 
                   Scores = Q √ó K·µÄ
These scores show how much focus each word should give to every other word.


Step 3: Normalize (Soft_max)
Attention Weights = soft_max(Q √ó K·µÄ / ‚àöd_k)
We divide by ‚àöd_k to stabilize gradients.

Step 4: Weighted Sum with V
Output = Attention Weights √ó V
This gives each word a new vector, enriched with context from all words.

| Query   | Q = X √ó W\_Q                | What we want to find            |

| Value   | V = X √ó W\_V                | Information of each word        |
| Scores  | Q √ó K·µÄ                      | How much to attend to each word |
