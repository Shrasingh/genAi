GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) is often preferred over LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) in practical deep learning tasks due to simpler structure, faster training, and comparable or even better performance in many cases.




| Feature     | LSTM                               | GRU                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gates       | 3 (input, forget, output)          | 2 (update, reset)                                          |
| Memory Cell | Yes (`c_t`)                        | No (merged with hidden state `h_t`)                        |
| Parameters  | More (due to more gates)           | Fewer                                                      |
| Speed       | Slower (more computation per step) | Faster                                                     |
| Performance | Good for long sequences            | Often performs equally well or better on shorter sequences |











Reasons to Prefer GRU
Faster Training:
Fewer gates = fewer parameters = less computation = faster training and inference.

Simpler Architecture:
Easier to implement and tune; good default choice when LSTM isnâ€™t giving clear benefits.

Comparable Accuracy:
GRUs often match or exceed LSTM performance on many tasks like sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and time series prediction.

Fewer Data Requirements:
With fewer parameters, GRU generalizes better on smaller datasets.



Task: Predict positive or negative sentiment from tweets (short text).

Dataset: Twitter Sentiment 140


| Model | Accuracy | Training Time |
| ----- | -------- | ------------- |
| LSTM  | 85.2%    | 120 minutes   |
| GRU   | 85.4%    | 80 minutes    |


ðŸ‘‰ GRU gives same or better accuracy with less training time â€” better efficiency!

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update gate $z_t$       | $z_t = \sigma(W_z x_t + U_z h_{t-1})$                    |
| Reset gate $r_t$        | $r_t = \sigma(W_r x_t + U_r h_{t-1})$                    |
| Candidate $\tilde{h}_t$ | $\tilde{h}_t = \tanh(W_h x_t + U_h (r_t \odot h_{t-1}))$ |
| Final state $h_t$       | $h_t = (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t$  |
