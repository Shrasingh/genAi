A perceptron is a fundamental building block in artificial neural networks, acting as a simplified model of a biological neuron. It takes multiple weighted inputs, combines them, and produces a single output based on a threshold. This output is typically binary, representing a decision (e.g., yes/no, 0/1).



Key Components and Function:
Input: A perceptron receives multiple inputs, which can represent features or data points. 
Weights: Each input is associated with a weight, representing its importance or influence on the output. 
Summation: The weighted inputs are summed up. 
Bias: A bias term is added to the sum, allowing the activation function to be shifted. 
Activation Function: The sum is then passed through an activation function, which typically outputs a binary value (0 or 1) based on a threshold. 
Output: The final output is a single value, indicating the perceptron's decision.
