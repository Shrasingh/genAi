üåê What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI model trained on massive amounts of text data to understand, generate, translate, summarize, and reason with human language.

It is based on deep learning, specifically using transformer architecture, and trained using self-supervised learning on datasets from books, websites, articles, and more.


üß† Why LLM?
To understand and generate human-like text

To answer questions, write code, translate languages, and even reason or summarize

To reduce manual work in tasks like writing emails, content creation, chatbots, coding, etc.

LLMs solve the natural language understanding and generation problem at scale.

üèóÔ∏è Introduction to LLM Architecture: How is it built?
LLMs are primarily built using Transformer architecture.

‚öôÔ∏è 1. Transformer Overview
Developed by Vaswani et al. in 2017 ("Attention Is All You Need")

Uses self-attention to process input in parallel (not sequentially like RNNs)

Core idea: Let the model "attend" to all words in the input



| Component                           | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embedding Layer**                 | Converts words into vectors (numerical form)                                      |
| **Positional Encoding**             | Adds position info to word vectors (since transformers don't have built-in order) |
| **Attention Mechanism**             | Determines which words to "focus" on when processing (esp. "Self-Attention")      |
| **Feedforward Layers**              | Neural network layers to process information further                              |
| **Layer Normalization & Residuals** | Help with stable training                                                         |
| **Decoder (for generation)**        | Converts processed info into output text                                          |


üîç What Does "Large" in LLM Mean?
‚ÄúLarge‚Äù refers to:

Billions of parameters (weights) ‚Äì e.g., GPT-3 has 175 billion

Huge datasets used for training

Complex capabilities (reasoning, multi-step logic, etc.)



| Type                       | Example                  | Specialty                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Autoregressive**         | GPT, LLaMA               | Predict next token                   |
| **Masked Language Models** | BERT, RoBERTa            | Predict missing words                |
| **Encoder-only**           | BERT                     | Text understanding                   |
| **Decoder-only**           | GPT-3, GPT-4             | Text generation                      |
| **Encoder-Decoder**        | T5, BART                 | Translation, summarization           |
| **Multimodal LLMs**        | GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude 3 | Handle text + image/video/audio      |
| **Instruction-tuned LLMs** | ChatGPT, Bard            | Follow human instructions in prompts |


üß™ Example: How LLM Works
Let‚Äôs say you input:

‚ÄúThe capital of France is‚Äù

LLM (like GPT) will:

Tokenize the input into ["The", "capital", "of", "France", "is"]

Use self-attention to understand how each word relates to others

Predict the next word with highest probability: "Paris"

Output: "The capital of France is Paris."

| Data Collection | Scraping the internet, books, articles, etc.          |
| Tokenization    | Break sentences into tokens (words/sub words)          |
