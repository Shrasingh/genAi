üîç What is an Optimizer in Machine Learning?
An optimizer is an algorithm used to adjust the weights of a neural network to minimize the loss function during training ‚Äî i.e., it helps the model learn by improving its predictions step-by-step.

‚úÖ Why is an Optimizer Needed?
Without an optimizer, the model won't know how to update its weights based on the error (loss). It's essential for:

Improving accuracy

Speeding up convergence

Escaping local minima

‚öôÔ∏è How is it Used?
In code (e.g., TensorFlow or P y Torch):

python
Copy code
optimizer = torch.opt I m.SGD(model.parameters(), l r=0.01)
It updates weights using gradients from backpropagation.

This happens in every iteration (epoch) of training.

üß† Types of Optimizers
Optimizer	Description
SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)	Updates weights using the average gradient; slow but simple
Momentum	Adds past gradients to smooth updates
AdaGrad	Adapts learning rate for each parameter; good for sparse data
RMSProp	Solves AdaGrad's decay issue; good for RNNs
Adam	Combines Momentum + RMSProp; widely used for deep learning
Na dam	Adam + Neste r o v momentum for faster convergence

‚úÖ Advantages
Efficient convergence to minimum loss

Handles sparse data (e.g., AdaGrad)

Works well with large datasets

Reduces training time (Adam, RMSProp)

‚ùå Disadvantages
Some may get stuck in local minima (e.g., SGD)

May require tuning learning rate

Can overfit if not regularized

Computational overhead (Adam uses more memory)
