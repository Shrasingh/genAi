 1. What is a Transformer?
A Transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper “Attention is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017).
It’s designed to process sequential data (like text) without using recurrence (RNN) or convolution (CNN).




🔷 2. Why was Transformer introduced?
✴️ Problem with older models (RNN, LSTM):
| Problem           | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🐢 Slow training  | RNNs process tokens **one by one**, making them **slow**. |
| 📏 Limited memory | Hard to capture **long-term dependencies**.               |
| 🚫 No parallelism | Cannot use GPU efficiently due to **sequential nature**.  |




✅ Transformer solves these by:
Using self-attention (not recurrence)

Allowing parallel processing (much faster)

Handling long-range dependencies efficiently




🔷 3. How does Transformer work? (Architecture Overview)
The Transformer has an Encoder-Decoder architecture.
Let’s break it down ⬇️

✅ Encoder (for understanding input)
Takes input sentence → Converts it into context-aware vectors

✅ Decoder (for generating output)
Uses those vectors → To predict output, one token at a time.




🔷 4. Transformer Building Blocks (from basic to advanced):
| Component                | Role                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔤 Input Embedding       | Converts words into vectors.                                                           |
| 🔢 Positional Encoding   | Adds **order info** (since there's no recurrence).                                     |
| 🎯 Self-Attention        | Helps each word "attend" to every other word in the sentence.                          |
| 🧱 Multi-Head Attention  | Runs multiple attention operations in parallel to **capture different relationships**. |
| ⚙️ Feed-Forward Network  | Applies fully connected layers to process information.                                 |
| 🔁 Layer Norm + Residual | Helps stable learning by normalizing and preserving gradients.                         |
| ⬆️ Stacked Layers        | Encoder and decoder each use **multiple such layers**.                                 |

🔷 5. Key Formula: Self-Attention
Let input matrix be X, then:
Q = XW_Q     // Query
K = XW_K     // Key
V = XW_V     // Value
Attention(Q, K, V) = soft_max(QKᵀ / √d_k) × V
Where:

W_Q, W_K, W_V: Learnable weight matrices

d_k: Dimension of the key vector (used for scaling)


🔷 6. Why is Transformer so Important?
