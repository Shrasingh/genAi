Corpus :  A corpus is a large collection of written or spoken texts used for linguistic analysis or natural language processing (NLP).
Document : single piece of text within a corpus it can be an article , a paragraph or even a sentence depending on how the data is structured
vocabulary: set of all unique words present in the corpus it can be article,a paragraph or even a sentence depending on how the data is structured
TOKEN: smallest unit of text 
frequency: no of times a particular token appears
Unigram: A single word.

Bigram: A sequence of two consecutive words.

Trigram: A sequence of three consecutive words.

N-gram: A sequence of n consecutive words used in language model.


TF-IDF(t,d,D)=TF(t,d)×IDF(t,D)
TF(t,d)= (Total number of terms in d) / (Number of times t appears in d​)

IDF(t,D)=log( 1+DF(t) / N )
TF-IDF in GenAI?
Helps highlight important words while down weighting common terms (like "the", "is", "and").

Improves text summarization, document retrieval, and semantic analysis.

Used in embedding techniques, before feeding into generative models or classifiers.
