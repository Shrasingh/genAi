Cross attention is a mechanism where a model learns to align and attend to information from another sequence‚Äîusually between an encoder and a decoder.



üéØ Why is Cross Attention Needed?
In sequence-to-sequence tasks like:

Machine Translation (e.g., English ‚Üí French)

Text-to-Image (e.g., in Diffusion Models)

Summarization, Question Answering

The decoder needs to focus on relevant parts of the encoder's output. Self-attention isn‚Äôt enough here because it only attends to the same sequence.


üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (High-level Intuition):
You have two sequences:

Query (Q): from decoder (what I‚Äôm trying to generate)

Key (K) & Value (V): from encoder (what I‚Äôm attending to)

Cross attention computes attention between these 

Attention(Q_from_decoder, K_from_encoder, V_from_encoder)

So the decoder knows what to focus on from the encoder output while generating each token.

| Component | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Q         | Queries (from decoder hidden state) |
| K         | Keys (from encoder output)          |
| V         | Values (from encoder output)        |

Attention(Q, K, V) = soft_max(Q √ó K·µÄ / ‚àöd‚Çñ) √ó V


| Feature   | Self-Attention                   | Cross-Attention                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Query     | From same sequence               | From decoder                              |
| Key/Value | From same sequence               | From encoder                              |
| Use case  | Encoding context/self-dependency | Decoder referencing encoder's information |


‚úÖ Summary:
Cross Attention = Decoder attending to Encoder

Why: Helps decoder focus on encoder outputs to generate relevant tokens

How: Uses Q (decoder), K/V (encoder) in dot-product attention

Used in: Transformers, GPT-4, BERT2BERT, Text-to-Image, Diffusion models
