NEED OF NEURAL NETWORK:
for the large dataset
non linear relationship
unstructured data 
features extraction
scalability

LAYERS:
input layer - data input
hidden layer - model training adjusting weight
output layer op 

Activation F - add non linearity 


PERCEPTRON vs MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON ->
only linearly separable data, can learn complex , non-linear functions making it suitable for a wider range of problems.
single layer, multiple layers to extract complex features at different levels of abstraction
limited capacity, adjustable model capacity
prone to underfitting, better fit for complex data
no or one hidden layer, hidden layers for better representation



Architecture-  
perceptron :- composed of a single layer of neurons
              only includes an input layer and an op layer
              lacks hidden layers

multi layer p :-  composed of multiple layers of neurons
                  includes an input layer,one or more hidden layers, and an output layer
                  hidden layers enable learning complex pattern
