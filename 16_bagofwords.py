#  Bag of Words (BoW) is a fundamental text representation technique used in NLP and GenAI. It converts text into numerical vectors based on word frequency, ignoring grammar and word order.

# ðŸ”‘ Key Points:
# Text to Numbers: Converts documents into vectors using word counts.

# Vocabulary Creation: Builds a list of all unique words in the corpus.

# Frequency Count: Counts how often each word appears in a document.

# Vector Output: Each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies.

# No Word Order: BoW ignores grammar and sequence of words.

# Applications: Used in text classification, similarity detection, and topic modeling.

# Strength: Simple but effective; forms the base for more advanced NLP models.
# corpus -> documents -> tokenize -> vocab -> frequency -> bag of words
# property - unordered based on frequency , when - text classification data small
# disadvanted - high dimensinality ,sparsity,no semantic meaning
